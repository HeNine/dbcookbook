	        \textbf{\large BEEF}

	        Use a cheaper cut of meat, like thigh, flank or shoulder. You'll be stewing it to soften and adding lots of spices to maximize the taste.

            \textbf{\large Onion}

            This is a pretty flexible recipe. You can use anywhere between 0.3 and 1.5 kg (per 1 kg of meat). I like a meatier version and onions make me farty.

            You can also use red or white or yellow onions OR A MIX! Fuck this boi up with onions!

            \textbf{\large Spice mix}

            The amounts here are eyeballed and I tend to go easy on cumin, but this mix works for me.

            Because we stew the meat for a long time I try to leave the herbs and spices in larger chunks: whole juniper berries, whole bay leaf, whole peppercorns, whole slightly crushed garlic cloves; I haven’t tried whole cumin and caraway, but that should also work.

            \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{goulash/IMG_20200202_095816.jpg}

            I pre-mix the spices with the tomato pur\'ee and the salt before adding them to the pot: mostly because I like how it looks and also to have something to do while the meat is browning.

    \preparation{

        \step Clean and cut the meat into walnut-sized qubes. You don’t have to remove all fat and connective tissue, but the more you leave the longer it will take to render and soften.

        \step Slice the onions. The onions will ``melt'' while they cook, so you can chop them very roughly: small onions into quarters, larger onions lengthwise into 1 cm strips. Also, you’re cleaning and slicing like a kilogram of onions; you don’t wanna finely chop that many onions, do you?

        \step Start saut\'eing the onions on high-mid heat on a bit of oil.

        \step When they start to brown add the meat. The meat will probably release a lot of liquid\footnote{ Normally, this effect, called ``crowding the pan,'' is bad as it can ruin the sear on a good steak, but in this case, we are going to stew the meat anyway, so it doesn’t change much.}. If that happens, raise the temperature and boil it off until it turns dark brown. This can take \textit{quite} a while. Otherwise, just brown the meat.

        \step Add wine and cook until it mostly boils off.

        \step Add the spices with the salt and the tomato pur\'ee and add just enough water to cover everything.

        \step Keep simmering on low for at least 90 minutes; the longer the better. Keep adding water if too much boils off. If you’re using a pressure cooker you can shorten that time, but honestly, use the same time to get a better result.

        \step Serve. I like to have some nice bread with it, but gnocchi is also an option or some other pasta. Really, any starch works.
