    ]{Fried Tofu}

    \introduction{
    	This dish is a creation of a friend of mine who is an avid cook as a vegetarian option at his wing nights. This dish changed my opinion of tofu -- it can be quite tasty when fried and appropriately seasoned!
	}

	\ingredients[8]{
		\SI{1}{package} & Firm tofu \\
		\SI{75}{\milli\liter} & Hoisin sauce \\
		\SI{50}{\milli\liter} & Saracha sauce \\
		\SI{25}{\milli\liter} & Sesame oil \\
		& A few pressed or finely diced garlic cloves \\
		& A few grams of grated or finely diced ginger \\
		& Snow peas \\
		& Broccolini
	}

	\preparation{
		\step Slice the tofu into strips about \SI{5}{\milli\meter} thick.

		\step Fry the tofu until golden on both sides. I pan fry the tofu in a small amount of vegetable oil but if you are ambitious you can deep fry the tofu.

		\step While the tofu is frying, mix the hoisin, sriracha, sesame oil, garlic and ginger in a bowl to make a sauce.

		\step When the tofu is cooked, dip the tofu in the sauce to coat it.

		\step Briefly fry the greens in the same pan as you fried the tofu.

		\step Serve the greens on the side or on top of the tofu and drizzle any remaining sauce over the greens.
